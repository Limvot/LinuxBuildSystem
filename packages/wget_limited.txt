echo "wget_limited is mostly only usful if no wget exists on the system, and is thus used to bootstrap the build process by building one for use in building the real wget with its OpenSSL dependnecy. The user provides the wget, and thus this next command should not download anything. If it fails, you probally haven't downloaded the wget-1.14.tar.xz and placed it in the correct directory"
